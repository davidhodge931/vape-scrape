world-smokefree-day-2022,NA,"We are now only 3 years before reaching our goal of a Smokefree New Zealand. Smoking has been on the decline with over 1,100,000 adults that have given up and we would encourage you to join them to help reach the 2025 Smokefree goal. It is more important than ever that we continue to spread awareness about the dangers of smoking and switch to less harmful alternatives such as vaping. This World Smokefree Day, we want to encourage as many Kiwis to quit smoking and seek a healthier life-style. If you want to join over 1 million Kiwis who have successfully quit smoking and learn how vaping can help you quit then read below.| These days there are many less harmful alternatives to smoking cigarettes, which has made it a lot easier for people to quit. These include vaping which has so far been the most popular choice for smokers wanting to quit, and for good reasons. Vaping allows people to stop smoking without cutting off nicotine completely.

SWAPPING OVER TO VAPING

These days there are many less harmful alternatives to smoking cigarettes, which has made it a lot easier for people to quit. These include vaping which has so far been the most popular choice for smokers wanting to quit, and for good reasons. Vaping allows people to stop smoking without cutting off nicotine completely. This is useful, because nicotine is the addictive part of smoking, but not the biggest health risk. There are thousands of ingredients in a cigarette that are extremely damaging (with many known to cause cancer) and vaping avoids all these harmful ingredients.

While it is generally accepted that vaping is less harmful than smoking, there are still some health risks associated with e-cigarettes. For example, vaping can cause irritation to the throat and lungs, and there have been some cases of serious lung injuries linked to vaping.However, it's also important to consider the positive aspects of vaping. One of the biggest benefits of vaping is that it can be a useful tool for people who are trying to quit smoking. E-cigarettes can deliver nicotine without the harmful chemicals found in tobacco smoke, making it a safer alternative for those who are struggling to quit smoking. In fact, some studies have found that e-cigarettes can be more effective than other quit-smoking aids, such as nicotine gum or patches.| Another benefit of vaping is that it can be a more socially acceptable alternative to smoking. E-cigarettes don't produce the same strong odor as tobacco smoke, which means that vapers are less likely to cause offense to those around them. This can be particularly important in public places where smoking is prohibited.| In addition to these practical benefits, vaping can also be a more enjoyable experience than smoking for many people. E-cigarettes come in a wide variety of flavors, which can be customized to suit individual tastes. This means that vapers can enjoy a more personalized and enjoyable experience than they would with traditional tobacco products.| Finally, it's worth noting that vaping can be a more environmentally friendly option than smoking. Cigarette butts are one of the most commonly littered items in the world, and they can take years to break down. In contrast, e-cigarettes don't produce any physical waste, which means that they can be a more sustainable option for those who are concerned about the environment.| In conclusion, while vaping is not completely risk-free, it can be a useful tool for people who are trying to quit smoking.

The difference between smoking and vaping is how nicotine is delivered into the body. Smoking delivers nicotine by burning tobacco and other chemicals, which creates tar and other toxins which are harmful to your health. Vaping heats up e-liquids which contain only a handful of ingredients including nicotine which is considered less harmful when compared to smoking cigarettes.
COST

Smoking cigarettes can be expensive because cigarette prices keep climbing ridiculously (a single cigarette will cost you approximately $2). If you switch over to vaping, you can save more than $8000 per year. Smoking cigarettes can cost you 10 times more than vaping.

The cheapest option is to not smoke or vape.

HARM
Smoking is threatening to your health because the burning of the tobacco creates the tar and harmful chemicals which you then inhale into your lungs. It does not just affect your lungs but your whole body, including your heart, oral health, bones, and skin. Vaping is not considered harmless but only contains a handful of ingredients (including nicotine) which is said to be up to 95% less harmful than smoking cigarettes.

SATISFACTION
Smoking and vaping both deliver nicotine. But the way they deliver and attain nicotine is also different. With smoking, you get a fixed amount of nicotine; Whereas when you vape, you can adjust the level of nicotine and gradually reduce it down until you are nicotine free. Although vaping is not the same as smoking, it is seen as the best alternative to smoking as it offers a similar experience and nicotine satisfaction.
“Nicotine itself does not have a significant impact on the health of people who smoke. It is the burning of tobacco that causes most of the harm.”

What is a vape device?

A vape device is an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette), e-vaporizer, or electronic delivery systems, are battery-operated devices that people use to inhale aerosol (vapor) which is produced by heating e-liquid.

Vape Kit
A vape kit consists of 3 parts; a coil, a tank and a mod. If you’re a beginner, you can start with a vape starter kit which has all 3 parts included and ready to use. A majority of starter kits only have one button to operate and do not require extensive knowledge on how to operate.
Vape Mod
The mod is the battery component of your vape which provides the power to the coil to heat the e-liquid. There are different types of mods available in the market, some are called regulated mods which gives you the ability to adjust the power output, this will change how warm your vape is and affects the flavour and vapor produced.
Vape Tank
The tank/pod of any vaping device holds your e-liquids and the coil. They come in different shape and sizes depending on the type of device you purchase.
Vape Coil
Coils are responsible for heating up e-liquid into a vapor. This is the only part of the device which needs to be replaced depending on how often you vape.
Closed vs Open Pod Device

Pod systems are the latest generation of vaping products. They are pocket e-cigarettes that are portable, discreet, and easy to use, making it one of the most popular options for smokers who want to find an alternative to smoking. Pod systems can deliver cigarette-like experience, imitating the convenience and impact that smokers crave.

Pod systems can be categorized into two types: Open Pod and Closed Pod.

Closed Pod Device
Pre-filled pod
Smallest type of device in the market, designed to be taken everywhere
Limited flavours and nicotine strengths to choose from
Who is it for?
Smokers looking for a discreet design
Smokers who prefer something compact and convenient
Smokers who have tried vaping unsuccessfully and looking to find something easier to use
Existing vapers who want a back-up device
Open Pod Device
Refillable pod
Small and compact device; suitable for everyday use
Opens up a world of flavour and nicotine options
In the long run, overall cost for open pod will be cheaper than closed pod
Who is it for?
Smokers who want a more customisable experience
Smokers and vapers who want to try out bigger and more powerful devices which give good flavour hit and satisfaction
Smokers who want unlimited flavour options
Direct-To-Lung vs Mouth-To-Lung

There are two types of vaping devices: mouth-to-lung (MTL) and direct-to-lung (DTL). As the name suggests, MTL vape is any device which you first draw the vapor into your mouth before inhaling it to your lungs. These are ideal for smokers or first time vapers because it closely resembles smoking cigarettes.

For those looking for more vapor while still satisfying their nicotine cravings, DTL vaping devices is the best bet. These types of device offer larger airflow and operate at a higher power which means that you can inhale a large amount of vapor with every draw you take. Because these devices operate at a higher power, it is recommended to use low nicotine strengths e-liquid.

What is E-Liquid?
E-liquid or e-juice is a mixture of food grade flavouring, propylene glycol (PG) & vegetable glycerine (VG) and a choice of nicotine levels (including no nicotine). E-liquid comes in different types of flavours. The mix of PG and VG alters the throat hit and amount of vapor you produce. High PG gives a strong throat hit and VG is gentler on the throat and produces bigger clouds. Flavours are personal preference. We have 3 different e-liquid nicotine bases:
Freebase Nicotine

Freebase nicotine is the first and most commonly found type of nicotine e-liquid on the market. Freebase nicotine e-liquids contain nicotine in its purest form which means that as the nicotine strength goes up, so does the throat hit. It is recommended for those looking to create large vapor, looking for a throat hit or for those who like to puff often throughout the day.

Freebase Nicotine Strengths are available in 0mg, 3mg ,6mg,9mg, 11mg, 12mg, 16mg, 18mg and 24mg.

View our range of Freebase Nicotine E-Liquids.

Nicotine Salts

Nicotine salt is nicotine which contains benzoic acid. This addition causes the nicotine to be less harsh and much more smooth when vaping. Because of this, higher nicotine strengths can be used while ensuring that the liquid is not harsh.Nicotine salt is good for people who are highly dependent on nicotine or people who do not want to puff often throughout the day but still get the nicotine satisfaction.

Note: Due to the nicotine strengths, we do not recommend these devices for sub-ohm or high-powered devices.

Nicotine salts are available in 0mg, 15mg, 20mg, 25mg, 30mg, 35mg, 40mg, 45mg, 48mg, 50mg, 60mg.

View our range of Nicotine Salts E-Liquids.

Sub-ohm Nicotine Salts

Sub-ohm nicotine salts use the ingredients found in nicotine salt e-liquid but in a much lower dosage. Sub-ohm nicotine allows you to enjoy the best of both worlds by allowing you to attain the satisfying nicotine hit and produce big clouds.

Sub-Ohm Nicotine Salts are available in 0mg, 3mg, 5mg, 9mg, 10mg.

View our range of Sub-ohm Nicotine Salts E-Liquids.

Learn more about the difference between Freebase Nicotine and Nicotine Salt

Getting Started With Your Vape
Priming The Coil

Priming your coil is a common method to ensure that your brand new coil will be saturated with e-liquid and prevent your coil from burning early on. To prime your coil, simply place a few drops of e-liquid onto the exposed cotton of the coil before installing it into the tank. Once your coil has been installed and the tank is filled with e-liquid, let it sit for a few minutes before use.

Switching Your Vape On And Off

Most devices are turned on/off by clicking the fire button 3 or 5 times consecutively. Make sure you switch off your vape if you’re not using it to ensure it doesn't accidentally fire in your pocket or bag which can damage the coil and battery.

Begin To Vape

To vape, simply inhale from the device while pressing on the fire button. If your device does not have a button, it means that you can just inhale and it will activate by itself. Avoid holding on to the fire button if you are not inhaling as this may cause the coil to burn faster and also the device to leak.

The retail premises from which they will sell vaping products is a fixed, permanent structure.
The proportion of sales that relate to vaping products sold from their retail premises meets the prescribed eligibility criteria (sales threshold) of 70%. The sales threshold relates only to the retailer’s physical retail premises – there is no minimum requirement for sales through their website(s) but a specialist vape retailer must sell vaping products at retail via their approved internet site(s).

Achieving the ""specialist vape retailer"" status means that a store can continue to sell all flavoured vape E-liquids and their related vaping products. Here at Shosha, we meet the requirements stated under the bill, therefore, we have registered all of our 120+ vape shop and operate as “specialist vape retailers”.

You can be rest assured that there will be no changes to Shosha vape store under these new laws - everything will still be readily available to make it convenient and safe for you to make the switch. This only affects general retailers that primarily sell other products, by limiting their E-liquid sales to tobacco, menthol, and mint flavours only.

The Volcano Device releases flavours and active ingredients from herbs through vaporization by hot air. Optimal treatment of the active ingredients reduces the development of harmful substances and odours to a minimum. This means that even non-smokers find the device enjoyable.  GET FREE SHIPPING ON ORDERS OVER $50.00.| The beauty of the Volcano Classic is its robust, purely electromechanical design, of which have already sold in tens of thousands. The Volcano Device releases flavours and active ingredients from herbs through vaporization by hot air. Optimal treatment of the active ingredients reduces the development of harmful substances and odours to a minimum. This means that even non-smokers find the device enjoyable.| Product Specification: 
Volcano devices come with a shapely, brushed metal cone. Care was taken to use flavorless materials that are food safe. Both the high-performance heating cartridge and the strong air pump can withstand the toughest stresses and strains.
An independent temperature fuse, air filter and silencer are naturally included in Volcano, as is a specially designed aluminium heat exchanger, which brings the air both cleanly and reliably to the desired temperature.
The well-known VOLCANO CLASSIC equipped with the new innovative EASY VALVE Starter Set, which features an optimized filling chamber. Valve balloons and mouthpieces are maintenance-free and always connected ready to use.
Optimum treatment of the active ingredients reduces the development of harmful substances and odours to a minimum. This means that even non-smokers find the device enjoyable.
A further advantage of the VOLCANO is the exploitation of active ingredients, being 3-4 times greater when compared with smoking, an aspect which makes the investment in the device pay for itself in the shortest time possible.
The temperature of the air fluctuates between the declared value in order of the heating and cool off process of the heat exchanger always around ± 9°F (5°C). So for example at grade 6 between 365°-383°F (185°-195°C)
The temperature was measured (when the air was streaming) in the middle of the filling chamber at the lower screen with an fast reacting, electronic thermometer.
Cellulose (organic material or plant material) has a point of spontaneous combustion at 455°F (235°C) and higher.
Tested and certified product safety and quality
Vaporisation temperature can be set
between 266° and 446°F (130° and 230°C)
Robust, completely electromechanical design
Three Months warranty
Temperature accuracy ± 9°F (5°C)

volcano-digital,NA,"The Digital Volcano features the same superb quality, exceptional vapor production, and easy-to-use, forced air operation as the Classic Volcano and includes an extra-large digital LED display with set and actual temperature.These easy-to-use features paired with incredibly flavorful, dense vapor make the Digital Volcano the most touted devices on the market today.| Like the Volcano Classic, the Volcano Digital is one of the most renowned, well-respected and advanced essential oil and aromatherapy devices offered on the market today. The Volcano Digital Device, which utilizes the same smooth cone structure, through its patented technology removes toxins and other harmful byproducts (i.e., tars and other carcinogens) through a vaporizing process which intensifies the effects of the active ingredients released through the vapor by approximately 75 percent. The German hand-crafted Volcano employs technology which circulates air enriched with the active ingredients of the substance vaporized into a balloon through a valve, until the balloon is filled. After the balloon is inflated the valve can be completely detached and separated from the device. The contents of the balloon can then be safely and comfortably enjoyed completely independent from the vaporization process. The balloon allows for vapor storage for up to 8 hours.| The new Volcano Digital device provides a prominent fully customized digital temperature LED display which immediately and precisely informs the user of the desired and actual operating temperature. The temperature on the Volcano Digital device ranges between 104 and 446 degrees Fahrenheit. Considering the temperature accuracy provided through the precision advanced electronic air temperature control and the built in air filtration system, the Volcano Digital device is the premiere choice for the true connoisseur.| SOLID VS. EASY VALVE:
The customers preferences and requirements were taken into consideration when developing the Easy Valve. The Easy Valve is characterized by very easy handling and minimal maintenance work. Attaching a new balloon to the valve is no longer required, as the Easy Valve comes as a ready to use valve balloon unit including mouthpiece. Once the Easy Valve can no longer be used, you simply replace the old with a new one. The starter set is delivered with 5 Easy Valve balloons and the appropriate filling chamber. The Easy Valve filling chamber is cleaned and re-used.| The Solid Valve is the standard valve and sold has sold in the tens of thousands. One can choose its individual balloon size as the Solid Valve Set comes with a box of 3 meters of balloon material. Using the Solid Valve, the replacement of the balloon is kind of tricky and needs some experience, but the Solid Valve provides a less expensive long-term option, as the balloon material can be bought for a reasonable price.| FREQUENCY OF BAG REPLACEMENT
The balloon should be replaced by a new balloon after cleaning the valve set in regular intervals (after 50 - 100 balloon fillings). The balloon used is the Volcano balloon. A roll with 3 meters of this product is enclosed with each Volcano, which is sufficient for 5-6 balloons. You may also use other heat-proof oven hoses or oven bags, e.g. in the U.S.A. use Reynolds oven bags Type large. Do not use any other plastic bags or cling wraps. On the other hand, once an Easy Valve can no longer be used, you simply replace the old with a new one. By far less seldom (approx. 1x per year in everyday use) although it may be necessary to replace the filling chamber screens. Each complete set is furnished with 3 upper and 3 lower screens.

How to setup Shisha:

Step 1. Place hookah stem (with vase gasket) into the glass vase. The fitting should be airtight.
Step 2. Place the metal tray over the top of the hookah stem. Depending on your hookah model, the tray may either fit loosely or snap into place. Some smaller hookahs come with affixed trays.
Step 3. Insert hose end with hose gasket into hose port on hookah stem.
Step 4. If your hookah model comes with an air release valve, unscrew it to make sure there is a ball bearing inside. Screw the valve back on. The air release valve is usually positioned opposite the hose port on the hookah stem.
Step 5. Check the air flow on your hookah by putting your hand over the top of the hookah stem and sucking in with the hose. There should be little to no air intake. If your hookah model has a check valve, with your hand still on top of the hookah stem, blow through the hose. You should hear air expelled out through the check valve.
Step 6. Remove the hookah stem from the vase and fill the vase with water. Put the hookah stem back on vase. The stem should be submerged about an inch into the water.
Step 7. Break up the shisha tobacco as you gently lay it into the clay bowl. You will want to sprinkle it in so that it is loose enough for air to pass through. The shisha tobacco should be filled to the rim of the bowl, but no higher.
Step 8. If you are using a metal screen, place it on top of the bowl. If you are using foil, wrap the foil over the head so that it fits snugly. Make sure to poke holes into the foil so that air can pass through.
Step 9. Place the clay bowl on top of the hookah stem with the bowl gasket in between the hookah stem and the bowl. The clay bowl should fit snugly.
Step 10. Light your coals. If you have instant lighting coals, you can light them with a lighter or match. Other coals will need a stove or a torch. Wait for the coals to become red hot all over before placing them on top of your clay bowl. Break the coals up into smaller pieces and evenly distribute them on your head. Be careful not to add too many coals as your smoke will become harsh.
Step 11. Inhale on your hose. It may take a minute or two before the hookah is smoking properly. Enjoy!

How to smoke the hookah:

Stir the shisha
Break up the shisha and place it in the bowl – Drop the pieces of shisha in the bowl and press down lightly to make a flat layer without making it too compact. It should stay fairly loose so that air can easily flow through it. Fill the bowl close to the top, but leaving at least 2mm of space above the shisha so it doesn’t burn.
Cover the bowl with foil and stretching it around the edges to make sure it stays on
Place the bowl on top of the ashtray – This should fit on securely into another rubber piece for an airtight fit, preventing air from entering.
Poke several holes through the foil – Using a toothpick or Shisha Bowl Puncher, poke about 12 – 15 holes through the foil surface. You can test the air flow by drawing on the hose as you do this if you have trouble pulling air, add more holes.
Light two or three coals (charcoals) by using a lighter
Place the coals (charcoals) on the foil – Place the coals evenly around the edge of the foil, let the shisha warm up for 3-5 minutes before you start smoking. This will allow you to smoke with gentle breaths and enhances the flavour.
Inhale – Once the bowl is warm, inhale using the hose, pull with short and normal breaths."
